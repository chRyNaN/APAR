# apar
**A**ctivity**P**ub **A**ddress **R**egistry - A de-centralized registrar for servers implementing the ActivityPub Specification.

This repository proposes this technology and may include an implementation in the future. 

### Naming
The name **apar** is an acronym for ActivityPub Address Registry. After a search, I learned that the [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apar) an apar is 
> the three-banded armadillo (Tolypeutes tricinctus) of South America
So that might make a good mascot for this repository in the future.
